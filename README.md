# Welcome to an Introduction to HPCC Systems
HPCC Systems is the Open Source **Data Lake** technology developed by LexisNexis Risk Solutions to solve Big Data problems for the LexiNexis business.

HPCC Systems is designed to host and process petabyte of data and integrate data from thousands of sources. 

One important distinction between other similar tools and HPCC Systems is that the innovation and quality of HPCC Systems has a direct impact to the success of LexisNexis. Therefore, HPCC Systems is rigorously tested and supported by experts in data analysis.  

HPCC Systems is used and certified in production environments within LexisNexis.

The following are a few facts that you need to keep in mind:

* HPCC Systems is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License
* LexisNexis uses the Open Source version
* 100% free online training and documentation
* AWS integration with Open Source cloud formation templates
* 100% free support for companies willing to build their own HPCC Systems expertise

The HPCC Systems introduction is divided into the following two parts:

## An introduction to the HPCC Systems architecture
The goal of the architecture discussion is to provide an introduction of HPCC Systems from the view of a solutions developer, and to answer questions such as - "why HPCC Systems uses a declarative approach to programming?" and "why HPCC Systems helps data scientists who understand the domain?"
